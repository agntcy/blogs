The AGNTCY project is the collective of contributors and maintainers building the Internet of Agents (IoA): an open, interoperable, internet for agent-to-agent collaboration. AGNTCY is proudly part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

The AGNTCY platform is an open source framework designed to enable standardized discovery, orchestration, and collaboration between AI agents across different frameworks and platforms (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, etc.) through standardized protocols.
